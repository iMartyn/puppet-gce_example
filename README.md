# Kubernetes Cluster Showcase

**Note:** This project is purely to show how Kubernetes can be used to manage a simple two-tier cluster on google compute engine.  To test it out you will need to have already installed the [google-cloud-sdk](https://cloud.google.com/sdk) and authenticated against an account.

**TODO:** complete this doc.
