# GCE Cluster Showcase

**Note:** This project is purely to show how puppet can be used to manage a simple two-tier cluster on google compute engine.  To test it out you will need to have already installed the [google-cloud-sdk](https://cloud.google.com/sdk) and authenticated against an account (gcloud init).

**TODO:** complete this doc.

## Other Requirements
* Puppet 3.x
--parser=future on the puppet command line or in your puppet config.
